h_ports_custom_service="<body bgcolor=#0099cc ><P><font size=4><B> Port Forwarding / Port Triggering Help </B></font></P><p>Port triggering is an advanced feature that you can use for gaming and other Internet applications. Port forwarding can typically be used to enable similar functionality, but it is static and has some limitations. </p><p>Port triggering opens an incoming port temporarily and does not require the server on the Internet to track your IP address if it is changed by DHCP, for example. </p><p>Port triggering monitors outbound traffic. When the router detects traffic on the specified outbound port, it remembers the IP address of the computer that sent the data and triggers the incoming port. Incoming traffic on the triggered port is then forwarded to the triggering computer.</p><p><a name=select></a>Using the Port Forwarding / Port Triggering screen, you can make local computers or servers available to the Internet for different services (for example, FTP or HTTP), to play Internet games (like Quake III), or to use Internet applications (like CU-SeeMe).</p><p>Port forwarding is designed for FTP, Web server, or other server-based services. Once port forwarding is set up, requests from the Internet are forwarded to the proper server. </p><p>The internal port range field must match the external port range field in these respects:</p> <ul><li>Both fields must have the same number of port ranges </li><li>Each port range in the internal port range field must have the same number of ports as its corresponding set in external port range field. </li></ul><p>For example, if you specify 30-50, 78, 100-102 in the External port range field, then 40-60, 99, 200-202 is one possible legal setting for the Internal port range field because it meets both criteria. However, 40-50, 200-202 is an illegal setting for the Internal port range field for two reasons:</p> <ul><li>Does not have the same number of port ranges (External port range field has three ranges, the illegal example has only two ranges)</li> <li>Each port range field does not have the same number of ports as its corresponding set in the External port range field (the illegal Internal port range field example.s first set has only 10 ports, while the External port range field set has 20 ports).</li></ul><p>Port triggering allows requests from the Internet only after a designated port is triggered. Port triggering applies to chat and Internet games.</p><hr><p><b>Port Forwarding</b></p><p>For the services, applications, or games that already exist in the drop-down list, you need to specify only the computer's IP address. Otherwise, you should specify the port number and computer's IP address for each service, game, or application by clicking the <b>Add Custom Service</b> button. </p><p><b> Port Assignment </b></p><p>You can make up to 20 different port assignments for Internet services, applications, or games. In the <b>Service Name</b> lists, you can select a service, an application, or a game. If you do not see an item that you want to use in any of the lists, check with the software or game developer for the correct port numbers to use.<p><b> For Internet Services </b></p><p> Before starting, you need to determine which type of services you will provide and the IP address of the computer that will provide those services. The most common services you would provide are a Web (HTTP) server or FTP server.</p><a name=setup></a><p>To set up a computer or server to be accessible to the Internet for an Internet service:<ol> <li> Select the Internet service you want to use from the <b>Service Name</b> list.</li> <li>Type the IP address of the computer in the<b> Server IP Address</b> field.</li> <li>Click <b>Add</b>.</li></ol><p><b>Note:</b> You might have a single computer or server available for more than one type of service. To do that, select another service, and type the same IP address for that computer or server.</p><p><b> For Internet Games or Applications </b></p><p> Before starting, you need to know which service, application, or game you will be configuring. Also, you need to have the IP address for the computer that you want to use.</p><p>To set up a computer to play Internet games or use Internet applications:<ol><li>Select the Internet application or game you want to use from one of the relevant lists. <br>The <b>Start Port</b> and <b>End Port</b> fields are filled in. <br><b>Note: </b>If you cannot find the game or application you want in one of the lists, click the <b>Add Custom Service</b> button, and enter the service name, starting port, ending port, and server IP address. </li> <li>Type the IP address of the computer in the <b>Server IP Address</b> field. </li> <li>Click <b>Add</b>. </li></ol><p>To set up an additional computer to play, for example, Hexen II or KALI:<ol> <li> Click the <b>Add Custom Service</b> button.</li> <li>Type the service name in the <b>Service Name </b> field.</li> <li>Type the beginning port number in the<b> Starting Port</b> field. <br>For these games, use the default number, and add 1 for each additional computer. For example, if you have already configured one computer to play Hexen II using port 26900, the second computer's port number would be 26901, and the third computer's port number would be 26902.</li> <li>Type the same port number in the <b>Ending Port</b> field.</li> <li>Type the IP address of the computer in the <b>Server IP Address</b> field.</li> <li>Click <b>Apply</b>. </li></ol><p>To modify a service entry:<ol> <li>Select the entry's radio button in the table. </li> <li>Click <b>Edit Service</b>. </li> <li>Modify the information in the <b>Service Name</b>, <b>Starting Port</b>, <b>Ending Port</b>, and <b>Server IP Address</b> fields. </li> <li>Click <b> Apply</b>. </li></ol><p>To delete a service entry:<ol> <li>Select the entry's radio button in the table. </li> <li>Click <b>Delete Service</b>. </li></ol></body>"

To access the router, you will type your router's WAN IP address into your browser's Address (in IE) or Location (in Netscape) field, followed by a colon (:) and the custom port number. For example, if your external address is 10.0.0.123 and you use port number 8443, enter in your browser:</p> <p><screen>https://10.0.0.123:8443</screen></p><hr><a name=access></a><p><b>Allow Remote Access</b><p> For security, you should restrict access to as few external IP addresses as practical. <p><ul>Select <b>Only This Computer</b> to allow access by only one IP address.</ul><p><ul>Select <b>IP Address Range</b> to allow access from a range of IP addresses on the Internet. Enter a beginning and ending IP address to define the allowed range.</ul><p><ul>Select <b>Everyone</b> to allow access by everyone on the Internet.</ul><hr><a name=port></a><p><b>Port Number</b></p><p>Web browser access usually uses the standard HTTP service port 80. For greater security, you can change the remote management Web interface to a custom port by entering that number in the field provided. Choose a number between 1024 and 65534, but do not use the number of any common service port.</p><hr> <p><b>To save or cancel changes:</b></p><a name=To></a><p>Click <b>Apply</b> to have your changes take effect.<br> Click <b>Cancel</b> to return to the previous settings.</p></body>"
