	# This is required for cases where large amount of network traffic is sent
	# instantaneously  without any ramp-up time , when CPU is at minimum perf level.

	# doesn't give any other thread including cpufreq thread a chance to run.
	# Hence, the CPU frequency is locked up at 384MHz till the traffic is stopped.
	# Increasing the min frequency for CPU0 to 800 MHz (L2=1GHz), allows 4 Gbps instantaneous
	# traffic without any hangs/lockups.
